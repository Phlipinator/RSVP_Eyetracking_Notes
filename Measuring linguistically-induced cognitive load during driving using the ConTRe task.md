## Short Summary ##
The paper presents a study in which the cognitive load of users is measured performing a secondary task during driving. For measurement of CL pupil diameter is used in a measurement called *Index of cognitive activity*.
*It is shown that "that fine-grained linguistic complexity has measurable effects on cognitive load", however there is no detailed description of a baseline recording for pupil dilation. It might be worth it to look deeper into the ICA definition.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "Compared to pupil dilation, the ICA has the advantage of being able to disentangle activation and inhibition patterns for reaction to light and reaction to cognitive activity."
