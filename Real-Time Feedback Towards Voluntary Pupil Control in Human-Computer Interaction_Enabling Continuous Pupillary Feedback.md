## Short Summary ##
"This paper presents the process and elaboration of real-time data filtering methods."
*A real-time filtering approach is presented that can help correct for unusual data and blinks during the recording of PD.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "Blinking, characterized by a rapid closing and opening of the eyelid, causes the eye-tracker to record invalid values. During this process, the lid gradually occludes and uncovers the pupil leading to incorrect size measurements."
- "For providing real-time continuous feedback, the applied method has to be able to reliably detect and replace blinks by valid pupil size measurements without causing a too large delay and distortion in the data stream."
- "it is suggested to individualize the sample-to-sample change criterion, making it less susceptible to interindividual variations. Therefore, at the beginning of the data collection, the criterion could be adjusted by measuring a subjects peak velocity of constriction."
