## Short Summary ##
A study is presented in which participants are presented with different news-headlines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic inside of a fact-checking system.  Cognitive load is measured using pupil diameter.
*A detailed description on how the base-value for measuring pupil diameter was found.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "To mitigate the effect of background luminance of pupil dilation, the color and luminance of the fact-checking-system interface was kept constant during the experimental session."
- "To eliminate individual variability in pupil sizes, we calculated a relative change in pupil diameter from a baseline for each participant."
