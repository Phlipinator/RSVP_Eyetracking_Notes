## Short Summary ##
The paper investigates the effect of different lighting conditions on the measurement of CL using PD.
*To get a baseline for PD, the average PD is calculated similar to the approach described in [[Measuring the impact of subtitles on cognitive load_eye tracking and dynamic audiovisual texts]] and [[Characterizing Relevance with Eye-tracking Measures]].*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "observation is consistent with previous empirical study that, luminance conditions take priority over cognitive demands in pupil diameter changes. Thus it is difficult to directly use the average pupil size or dilation to measure cognitive workload in the experiment."
