## Short Summary ##
The paper presents a study, in which users are shown bar graphs, which get altered for easier understanding using a couple of different techniques. During the experiment the pupil diameter of the users is recorded.
The experiment was conducted in a "windowless room with uniform lighting" and to account for physiological differences between users, a baseline pupil-size is collected.
*The approach to measure the baseline for pupil dilation seems to be simple and very similar to the technique used in [[Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data]]*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "The long term goal of our research is to design user-adaptive visualizations that can support users based on their individual needs."
- "(...) following a standard approach found in the literature, involves having participants stare at a blank screen for several seconds."
- "(...) we measured an alternative calibration baseline by displaying a mock bar graph visualization in order to produce similar lighting conditions to a real study task."
- "(...) how pupil dilation measurements can be leveraged to better understand information visualization processing."
- "(...) pupil size could be leveraged as a real-time indicator of cognitive load to detect if users are having difficulty."
