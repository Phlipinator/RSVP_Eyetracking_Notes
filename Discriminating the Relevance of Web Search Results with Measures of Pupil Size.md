## Short Summary ##
A study is presented that tests "whether pupil size can be used to discriminate the perceived relevance of web search results."
*A baseline calculation similar to the subtractive method described in [[Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data]] is used.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "For each blink, we removed the three samples immediately before and after the missing data points."
- "We averaged the blink-corrected data for the two eyes"
- "We then calculated a baseline value as the average pupil diameter in the 500 ms time window preceding the presentation of each result and subtracted this value from the corresponding epoch to measure the change in pupil diameter elicited by the results."
