## Short Summary ##
"A novel eye-tracked measure of the frequency of pupil diameter oscillation is proposed for capturing what is thought to be an indicator of cognitive load. The proposed metric, termed the Index of Pupillary Activity, is shown to discriminate task difficulty vis-Ã -vis cognitive load (if the implied causality can be assumed) in an experiment where participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target (a requirement for replication of prior work)."
*The above approach to measuring CL is described in detail and could be considered an alternative to relative pupil dilation. However the measurement could be harder to archive.*
The IPA provides a free-to-use alternative to the ICA described in [[The index of cognitive activity_Measuring cognitive workload]].
