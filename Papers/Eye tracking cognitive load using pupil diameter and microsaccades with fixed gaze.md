## Short Summary ##
A comparison between microsaccades and pupil diameter as measurements for cognitive load is presented.
*The approach on how to retrieve the baseline for pupil dilation is well documented, however it seems to bee too complicated for real-time calculation.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
-  "we compare microsaccadic metrics to measures of pupil diameter, namely the averaged difference in pupil diameter with respect to inter- or intra-trial (averaged) baseline."
- "pupil diameter should be measured with respect to the average pupil diameter measured during a baseline trial (termed here inter-trial change in pupil diameter—BCPD)"
- "pupil diameter should be measured with respect to the average pupil diameter measured during a baseline measurement made at the beginning of each trial (termed here intra-trial change in pupil diameter—CPD)"
