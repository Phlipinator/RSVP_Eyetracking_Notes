## Short Summary ##
In this paper a study is described where CL is measured via eye-tracking to modify the  difficulty of a pong game in real time. 
*The paper serves as a demonstration of the usefulness of CL-estimation with pupil-dilation for real-time applications -> RSVP.*
*There is no real description of how the baseline was calculated other than "pupil diameter was z-standardized within participants across the difficulty levels for further analyses."*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "findings demonstrate the usefulness of pupil diameter as basis for psychophysiologically dynamic difficulty adjustment as it is sensitive both to under- and overload, hence underlining pupil dilation’s potential value for user-adaptive interfaces in general."
- "It has later been demonstrated that this increase in pupil diameter is not linearly connected to task difficulty, as overly difficult tasks will overload and cause participants to give up (Granholm et al. 1996)."
- "Pupil diameter was blink filtered using an interpolation approach for blinks, built on the physiologically possible boundaries of changes in pupil diameter as threshold for blink detection (Georgi et al. 2014). Pupil diameter was then averaged for each experimental condition. Subsequently, pupil diameter was z-standardized within participants across the difficulty levels for further analyses."
