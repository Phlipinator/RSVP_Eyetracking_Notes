## Short Summary ##
A study is presented in which the cognitive load is measured using eye tracking metrics "like blink duration, frequency and interval and pupil dilation" while performing eye-typing tasks. The cognitive loads gets altered through task difficulty ("memorizing sentences of varying complexity").
*The same baseline-measurement for relative pupil size is used as in [[Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data]].*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "Pupil dilation indicated the memorization process, but did not demonstrate a difference between easy and difficult tasks."
- "The relative pupil size was calculated from the baseline pupil size measured during the 5s break between trials."
- "Pupil dilation was affected by the task of memorization, with a higher pupil dilation when the participants had finished memorization of the sentence, and pupil constriction as an effect of finishing typing of the sentence."
- "(...) pupil dilation, in our experiment, did not indicate a difference between easy and difficult sessions."
