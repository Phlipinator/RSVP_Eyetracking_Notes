## Short Summary ##
"The contribution of this paper is an investigation of the combined influence of light and mental workload on the user’s pupil size."
A model of PD-change is created which incorporates the effects of different lighting conditions on the pupil. "We see this model as a first step towards pupil-based illumination-independent workload estimation."
Both an experiment for ambient lighting as well as for screen illumination is conducted.
*The baseline is calculated by using the average PD for every task.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "A key issue with using eye-tracking data to infer mental workload is that physiological changes in the eye are influenced both by lighting conditions and the difficulty of the task a person is engaged in."
- "For each of the 20 participants we found the average pupil diameter for each of the experimental condition."
- "m. At the beginning of each trial, we measured the amount of light reaching the participant’s eyes with a lux meter (...) placed at the participant’s forehead."
