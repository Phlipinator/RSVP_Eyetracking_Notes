## Short Summary ##
The paper presents an approach where CL estimation through eye tracking is utilized to predict the challenging parts of source code. Using the collected data predictions then can be made on untested code with precision over 80%.
*Pupil dilation is described as one of the most promising physiological features to estimate CL, but no exact description of how the baseline is measured is provided.*
