## Short Summary ##
A study is presented in which eye-tracking data (more precisely pupil dilation and blink rate) is used to measure CL to better understand program comprehension.
*A detailed description on how pupil dilation is measured and corrected fro screen brightness is provided.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "As our snippets are not uniform in length, each snippet is different in their perceived brightness. Thus, the snippets may influence pupil dilation by their brightness, independent of the change in cognitive load."
- "Because a standardized brightness of the stimuli is infeasible for us (i.e., snippets will generally differ in length), we will need to correct the baseline pupil dilation for each snippet."
- "Ideally, tasks are used that do not require any eye movement."
  *-> No correction for eye-movement necessary in RSVP*
  "due to the strong linear relationship between screen brightness and pupil dilation, we may be able to correct for the changing brightness in a thorough analysis."
