## Short Summary ##
In this paper heart-rate variability and pupillometry assessment are tested for their reliability to asses CL.
The work focuses on the effect that lighting conditions have on the results.
*The filtering process of how the pupil data was analyzed is described in detail.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "the diameter does not suffer any effect from luminance because both conditions (light and no light) are equal."
- "Light does not seem to have significant effect on the measurements but does influence the variance of the results."
