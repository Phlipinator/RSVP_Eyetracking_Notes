Found through [[True or false Cognitive load when reading COVID-19 news headlines_an eye-tracking study]]

## Short Summary ##
A study is presented in which texts of different relevance are shown to the user while the cognitive load is measured using eye tracking measurements. The results indicate a correlation between the perceived relevance of the read text and CL.
*As a baseline for pupil diameter an average above all tasks is computed.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "Controlled lab environment with constant lighting, and the use of text documents with black background and a similar number of words presented in white font ensures virtually constant luminance across all experiment sessions."
- "To eliminate individual variability in pupil sizes, we obtained a baseline for each participant by taking an average pupil size over all text document stimulus presentations"
