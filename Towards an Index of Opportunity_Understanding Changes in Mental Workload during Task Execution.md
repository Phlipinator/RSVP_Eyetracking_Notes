## Short Summary ##
A study is presented that measures CL using PD while users perform different tasks and sub-tasks.
*The baseline is recorded by having the user look at a blank screen for 1o seconds, similar as described in [[Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data]]*
