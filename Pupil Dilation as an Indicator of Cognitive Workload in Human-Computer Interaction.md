## Short Summary ##
The paper presents a novel calibration interface, which "which is capable of almost completely eliminating the geometry-based distortion of pupil-size data for any human subject". The effects of different environment variables like display brightness are also investigated.

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "the increase in pupil area induced by higher task demands was almost identical for black backgrounds (...) and white backgrounds"
