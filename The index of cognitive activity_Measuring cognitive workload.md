Found through [[True or false Cognitive load when reading COVID-19 news headlines_an eye-tracking study]]

## Short Summary ##
The index of cognitive activity (ICA) is presented, which "provides an important estimate of the levels of cognitive effort of the user" based on measurements of the pupil diameter.
*For this approach no baseline recording of pupil diameter seems to be necessary as similar to [[The Index of Pupillary Activity_Measuring Cognitive Load vis-Ã -vis Task Difficulty with Pupil Oscillation]] the ICA "measures abrupt discontinuities in the signal created from continuous recording of pupil diameter."*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "The ICA has several advantages over other techniques that measure changes in pupil dilation. First, it does not require averaging over trials or over individuals"
