## Short Summary ##
A demonstrator is built which visualizes pupil dilation and cognitive load in real time. *There is however no information about how the baseline for the pupil dilation is measured, instead a real-world camera measures illumination and the calculation compensates for that value.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "As the pupil diameter is not under voluntary control, it represents a promising indicator and psychological reporter variable of internal cognitive processes."
