## Short Summary ##
The paper presents a study in which eye-tracking (including pupil diameter) is used to measure CL in order to adapt game-difficulty in real time. The game used for the study is an emergency simulator, where players have to micro-manage emergency-personnel in different scenarios.
The focus of this work is on the Machine-learning part created on basis of the collected data which is not of interest.
The real-time use of CL through pupil diameter is somewhat similar to [[Pupil Dilation Fulfills the Requirements for Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Gaming on the Example of Pong]].
*A detailed description on how pupil-dilation-data was processed is provided.*

## Interesting Quotes ##
- "Often it is beneficial to adapt a system in a way that the cognitive load experienced by a user does not exceed a critical level."
- "We also removed data points up to 100 ms directly before and after a blink."
- "Because the analyzed time periods are very short and thus susceptible to noise, we used the median of pupil diameter instead of the more commonly used mean."
